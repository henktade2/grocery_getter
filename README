Sample code to illustrate persistence for iPhone development

The using_fmdb example uses code from http://code.google.com/p/flycode/ and http://github.com/mocra/fmdb-migration-manager/

To build the using_ar example, download a zip from http://github.com/aptiva/activerecord/ and unpack to the using_ar directory as a directory named activerecord-read-only.
